/*Write a piece of code that finds the solutions for a quadratic equation.
 You can use the following template:
*/
const a = 1; b = -6; c = 9;  // stands for x**2 - 6*x + 9 = 0;
let solutionA = solutionB = 0;
// your code goes here
solutionA = (x*x - (x*b) + c);
console.log(solutionA, solutionB);

/*You can find on Google the formula to find the solutions. 
Test your code on different a, b, c values (like 1, 5, 6 or 1, -1, -1)*/
